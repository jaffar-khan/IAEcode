Query: What are the main types of neural networks?

Response: Here's what I found:

Neural Networks:
  types: ['Feedforward Neural Networks', 'Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)', 'Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)', 'Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)', 'Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)', 'Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN)', 'Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)', 'Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)', 'Deep Belief Networks (DBN)', 'Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)', 'Autoencoders']
  description: Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain that consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information.
